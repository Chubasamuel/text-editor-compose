Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California, 
in October 2003 by Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, 
and Chris White.[20][21] Rubin described the Android project as having "tremendous potential in 
developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences".[21] 
The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras, 
and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004.[22] 
The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals, 
and five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as a handset operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile.[22][23]
Rubin had difficulty attracting investors early on, and Android was facing eviction from its office space. 
Steve Perlman, a close friend of Rubin, brought him ${'$'}10,000 in cash in an envelope, 
and shortly thereafter wired an undisclosed amount as seed funding. 
Perlman refused a stake in the company, and has stated "I did it because I believed in the thing, and I wanted to help Andy."[24][25]

In 2005, Rubin tried to negotiate deals with Samsung[26] and HTC.[27] Shortly afterwards, 
Google acquired the company in July of that year for at least ${'$'}50 million;[21][28] 
this was Google's "best deal ever" according to Google's then-vice president of corporate development, 
David Lawee, in 2010.[26] Android's key employees, including Rubin, Miner, Sears, and White, 
joined Google as part of the acquisition.[21] Not much was known about the secretive Android Inc. at the time, 
with the company having provided few details other than that it was making software for mobile phones.[21] 
At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. 
Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible, upgradeable system.[29] 
Google had "lined up a series of hardware components and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation".[attribution needed][30]

Speculation about Google's intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through December 2006.
[31] An early prototype had a close resemblance to a BlackBerry phone, with no touchscreen and a physical QWERTY keyboard, 
but the arrival of 2007's Apple iPhone meant that Android "had to go back to the drawing board".[32][33] 
Google later changed its Android specification documents to state that "Touchscreens will be supported", 
although "the Product was designed with the presence of discrete physical buttons as an assumption, 
therefore a touchscreen cannot completely replace physical buttons".[34] By 2008, 
both Nokia and BlackBerry announced touch-based smartphones to rival the iPhone 3G, and Android's focus eventually switched to just touchscreens. 
The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC Dream, also known as T-Mobile G1, announced on September 23, 2008.[35][36]
